Design a database of books, authors and locations (i.e. rooms in the house and
shelves). 

The interface would be a simple webpage allowing search, adding, modifying, and
deleting books. Front-end HTML5, backend Python/django and a MySql server.

It can be locally hosted on a raspberry pi (the new $5 ones) plugged directly
into the router (so it has a static IP).
